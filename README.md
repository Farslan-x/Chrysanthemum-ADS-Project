# Chrysanthemum: Autonomous Vehicle Crash Analysis 🚗

This project involves the detailed analysis and visualization of crashes involving vehicles equipped with automated driving systems (ADS), based on data provided by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration).

## 👥 Project Team
* **Bengisu ÖZBİLEN** -
* **Ferhat ARSLAN**

## 📊 Project Summary
Using data collected under NHTSA's Permanent General Order, accidents involving vehicles equipped with automated driving systems or SAE Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems were examined.

The objectives of this study are:
* To identify safety concerns regarding ADS technologies,
* To analyze accident densities geographically and temporally,
* To make safety inferences based on brand and model.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used
The project was prepared in **Quarto** format using the **R** programming language.

* **Data Processing:** `tidyverse`, `readxl`, `dplyr`
* **Visualization:** `ggplot2`, `ggthemes`, `ggpubr`, `maps`
* **Reporting:** `kableExtra`, `flextable`, `skimr`

## 🔎 Key Findings

1. **Location Analysis:** The highest number of accidents occurred in the city of **San Francisco**, California. This is due to population density and the frequency of ADS testing in this area.
2. **Time Analysis:** It has been observed that automated driving systems perform inefficiently during times of light transition, such as **evening darkness and dawn.**
3. **Brand Analysis:** The brands with the most reported accidents in the data set were found to be **Jaguar** and **Cruise.**
4. **Road Surface Conditions:** Accident rates for vehicles on wet and dry surfaces were examined, and the effect of road surface was analyzed.
